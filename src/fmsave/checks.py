"""Reader checks, and the validation report built from them.

While a reader decodes, it counts what it sees into a stats record from `fmsave._reader_stats`
(`PlayerStats`, `ContractStats`, `ClubStats`, `SuspensionStats`, `ManagedStats`, `StageStats`,
`CompetitionStats`, `FixtureStats`, `TransferWindowStats`, `LeagueTableStats`, `RulesStats`,
`MatchStats`, `StadiumStats`, `FinanceStats`, `FacilityStats`, `AffiliateStats`,
`JobVacancyStats`, `StaffStats`, `InjuryTypeStats`, `InjuryStats`, `TrainingStats` or
`TacticStats`).
The `evaluate_*` functions compare those counts with the loose `GateBounds` registered for the
save's layout and return one `GateResult` per check, and `enforce` raises `ReaderCheckError`
when an applied check failed, before the reader caches its table. The checks apply only to a
`game_db` of at least `GateBounds.minimum_applies_from_bytes`, since smaller sections come from
fragments that cannot meet full-save counts.

`validate_save` runs every reader and returns a `ValidationReport`, which holds only structural
facts, counts and rates: never names, uids or other values from the save.

Only the names in `__all__` are public. `ReaderCheck`, `GateCheckError`, `_gates_disabled` and
the `evaluate_*`, `check_*` and `enforce*` functions are internal to fmsave.

    found no block at all: an empty result scores below the block floor, the duplicate floor
    and the division floor, and leaves the two shares without a denominator, so a table layout
    that has moved fails here rather than reporting a career with no tables.

    `table_venue_calendar_agreement` is the exception, and is the check that keeps the slot
    parity honest. It compares the venue the slot's parity names against the venue the fixture
    calendar's own stored home team names, on the tables whose rows account for exactly one
    season of that calendar. Reading the parity the other way round drops it from about 0.998
    to about 0.002 on every save measured, so a parity chosen wrongly fails here. Its
    population is legitimately empty on a layout that settles no parity and on a career whose
    tables are all out of step with its calendar, so an empty population is reported rather
    than failed; the four count checks above are what fail when the table decode itself found
    nothing.

    Two of the five exist to catch a filter that stopped filtering, which no rate here can see.
    `table_block_duplicates_minimum` fails when the deduplication stops dropping the save's
    repeated copies of a block: the copies are sound blocks differing from the block they
    repeat only in undecoded head bytes, so they pass every other check, and left in they
    shatter the tables they sit in, turning about 800 tables into about 4,700 on the corpus.
    That floor is the only check that sees it, because every shattered piece is still shaped
    like a small table; the division count barely moves, so it is not a second tripwire for
    this failure and is not presented as one.
    `double_round_robin_divisions` guards the opposite failure, a grouping that runs tables
    together: a merged group holds clubs twice over and cannot keep a division's shape, so the
    count collapses. `table_groups_resolved` sees neither, since one enormous group scores a
    perfect 1.0 on it.

    `table_groups_resolved` observes near 1.0 on every save measured, which reads stronger than
    it is: 30% to 43% of tables hold a single block, and a one-block table meets the vote's
    half-the-members rule on a majority of one. Over the tables of two blocks or more the share
    is 0.998 to 1.000, so this gate is a floor under a near-saturated rate rather than a

    the parsed share with no denominator, which fails for want of a rate rather than passing
    quietly. That is what a marker that has moved looks like from the counts, and it is why the
    share is not allowed to stand alone.

    `rules_fully_parsed` counts the strict sense of a parsed block: the promotion quad written
    twice identically **and** the tie-break list, the prize list and every round record
    decoded. A share measured without the quad sits about ten points higher, so this gate's
    bound is not comparable with one.

    The last two judge the positional competition link, and they fail on different faults.

    `rules_link_round_dates` is the share of a linked block's dated rounds that fall on a date
    the linked competition plays a fixture on. Its misalignment is taking the run of table
    blocks stored before a block rather than the run after it, which drops the share from 0.74
    to 0.78 down to 0.55 to 0.58 on the saves measured. It is a share with no population of
    its own to fall back on, so an empty link leaves it without a denominator and is reported
    rather than failed.

    `rules_linked_blocks_minimum` is the count that closes that hole, and it is a count on
    purpose: the misalignment above permutes the same runs among the same blocks, so **every
    share built from this link is invariant under it** -- the share of blocks that link at all
    is 0.55 to 0.68 whichever run is taken -- and only a count falls when the link stops
    linking. It applies above `rules_link_minimum_applies_from_runs` blocks with a run, so a

    They judge a section of a few megabytes rather than `game_db`, so they apply from that
    section's own size: a smaller one comes from a fragment that cannot meet full-save counts.

    The walk is the structural check and it raises rather than scoring here, because the
    section is four arrays and three lists back to back with no signature to search for: a
    start or a stride read wrong cannot consume it exactly. What these shares add is a
    judgement of each row's own shape and of the two joins the rows carry, and every one of
    them separates a sound decode from the same rows read one or four bytes late.

    `injury_log_ascending` is judged on the steps between rows whose date decodes, and it is
    deliberately **not** excused when there are no such steps: a section full of rows from
    which not one date decodes is what a decode read one byte out looks like, so it fails
    there for want of a rate. The typed shares are excused when
    the section holds no typed row, and the recent-team share when no row of the last month
    has a player with a team, because a career can legitimately hold neither. The type share
    is excused as well when the name table is empty, since a save carrying no per-match file
    holds these names nowhere at all.

    `injury_typed_dates_near_clock` is a share of **every** typed row, not of the dated ones.
    Taken over the dated rows it is 1.0 read correctly and 1.0 read one byte late as well, so
    it could not fail its own misalignment; over every typed row it falls from 0.988 to zero.
    It subsumes a plain check on how many rows carry a date and catches one thing more: a date
    read from neighbouring bytes that decodes to a year the game has long passed, which is
    where every date that still decodes one byte late lands. The band it judges against is
    much wider than any deviation measured, because how far behind the in-game date the game
    keeps a typed row is career state: five of the seven save states measured held nothing
    older than seven days and two held a full day's rows at eight days, so a bound drawn
    tight round either figure fails a section read correctly. `typed_rows_over_a_week_old` is
    reported as an anomaly for that reason and no gate judges it.

    One counted share carries no gate: how many log rows still name a player runs 0.94 to
    0.96 and is career state, since a person the save no longer keeps as a player is a real
    row the game still shows. It is reported as an anomaly instead.

    vacancies years old, and a manager between jobs may see very little of it, so **no floor is
    put under its size at all** and no share is judged on a handful of rows.

    That leaves a hole a share cannot close: a locator reading the wrong section would return an

    sits in the reader: the section's size has to be its header plus its record size times the

    date decodes, not on the records, and it is deliberately **not** excused when there are no
    such steps. A feed of twenty records or more from which not one date decodes is what a
    decode read one byte out looks like, so it fails there for want of a rate.

    Two counted shares carry no gate. Team ids resolve on 0.93 to 0.98 of records, but ids are
