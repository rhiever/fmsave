    `fully_parsed` counts the blocks whose promotion quad was written twice identically **and**
    whose tie-break list, prize list and every round record decoded. That is stricter than

    `linked_rounds` counts the dated rounds those blocks hold and `linked_rounds_in_calendar`
    the ones falling on a date that competition plays a fixture on. That is the corroboration

    the saves measured. `linked_round_shape` counts the blocks whose number of rounds is what

    count and **not** a gate: it scores 0.71 to 0.77 linked against 0.56 to 0.62 misaligned, so

    """What reading the job-centre feed counted.

    `records` counts every record the section holds. `tagged` counts those carrying the record
    tag, and `reserved_zero` those whose two reserved fields are both zero.

    `dates_ordered` counts records whose advertised date decodes and is on or before the save's
    in-game date **and** whose second date decodes and is on or after the advertised one.
    `advertised_steps` counts the moves from one record with a decodable advertised date to the
    next, and `advertised_ascending_steps` those that did not reach an earlier date: the save
    stores the feed in advertised order, so a step backwards is a decode that has moved rather
    than a quirk of the career.

    `competitions_known` counts records naming no competition or one the stage table holds, and
    `teams_resolved` those whose team id a club lists. Neither carries a gate: team ids are
    dense enough over the feed's range that the second cannot fail, and the first is 1.0 both
    read correctly and with the record start shifted four bytes. Both are reported instead.

    `with_competition` counts records that name a competition at all, `with_league_position`
    those storing a position in its table, and `flagged` those whose 0/1 flag is set.

    """What the walk over the manager's team blocks counted.

    `managed_club_exists` is False on a save that lists no human manager with a club, which is
    what decides whether any of these counts is judged at all: there is then no team block to
    read and both tables are empty.

    `club_team_count` is how many teams the managed club fields, `header_blocks` the number of
    blocks the section header claims and `blocks_found` how many teams the section stores
    exactly one block for. `selector_matches` is whether the section header names the same
    human manager as the `humans` section.

    `selection_selectors` counts every player selector the blocks store, over the selection
    slots, the two selector lists, the single selector, the ten set-piece lists and the eight
    order lists; `selection_selectors_resolved` those a player record names, and
    `selection_selectors_at_club` those of them registered with the managed club. Nothing of
    the selection itself is shipped: these counts are what says the selectors are still being
    read where they sit.

    `tactic_blocks` counts the blocks whose stored count claims a tactic record and
    `tactic_blocks_count_matching` those where every record it claims was found.
    `user_tactics` counts the records the manager wrote, `preset_tactics` those in the game's
    own format, which are counted and skipped. `slot_walks_complete` counts the user records
    whose 22 slot blocks walked and `oop_index_permutations` those whose out-of-possession
    index bytes are a permutation of the slot numbers.

    `routine_blocks` counts the blocks whose routines were searched for,
    `routine_blocks_with_twenty` those holding exactly the number of routine slots a block is
    expected to hold, `routines` the rows built from them and `named_routines` those with a
    name.
