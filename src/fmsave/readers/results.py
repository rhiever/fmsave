"""Stage-keyed results: the match scores a save still holds, joined onto the calendar.

A fixture record carries no score, so the goals of a finished match come from a separate
27-byte record that names the match by its date and its two team ids. Those records sit in the
unnamed span and in four named sections, and one locator reads them in all five, so the record
shape is written down once.

**The join is the evidence, not the locator.** A 27-byte shape with two short locator bytes
matches by chance many times over in a hundred megabytes, and acceptance turns away almost
nothing on its own. What says these records are matches is that they join the fixture calendar,
which another reader found in another region under an entirely different locator, on the date
and both team ids at once. Joined with the two sides swapped, or with the date moved a single
day, the same records join nothing at all.

Scope is decided in two steps, because the records are collected before the calendar exists.
The span pass runs first and can only apply the tests the record answers by itself: the locator
bytes, the team range, the goal ceiling and a date that decodes. Whether a record is in scope
needs the fixture calendar and the stage table, so one predicate, `result_in_scope`, is applied
afterwards to the span's records and the sections' records alike. Neither path has an acceptance
rule of its own.

The acceptance window is the calendar's own first and last date. A record dated outside the
range the calendar covers can never join a fixture, whatever is done with it: a save keeps
several seasons of history these records describe and no fixture survives to carry it, so those
records are dropped for want of somewhere to put them, not because they are wrong.

Retention is partial by design. The same match is stored about 1.8 times over, but only about a
quarter of a career's played matches still carry a score at all; `played` with empty goals means
the save no longer holds the result, not that the match finished goalless.
