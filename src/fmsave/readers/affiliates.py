"""Walking the groups of clubs in the `feeder_man` section and joining them to their clubs.

The section is a header and then variable-length groups back to back, so there is nothing to
search for: the walk starts at the layout's group offset and consumes exactly as many groups as
the header claims. It has to end on the section's last byte. That is the whole structural
check, and it is a strong one, because the only way to land on the last byte is to have read
every count in between correctly: a header read one byte out claims a group count of millions
and fails on the first group it cannot fit.
