"""Walking the team blocks of the `training_man` section, and finding the schedule library.

The section is a per-person header list, then one variable-length block per team of the club
the save's manager runs, then tens of kilobytes of other data. Nothing is searched for to
reach a block: the header list's own count says where the first one starts, and each block
ends where its mentoring groups do. What ends the walk is the blocks running out, which the
save marks by following the last one with bytes that are not another block of a team of that
club, so the check on the walk is that it found exactly as many blocks as the club has teams.
Starting one byte or four bytes late parses no block at all.

Inside a block the calendar is the part worth being careful about. Each weekly record is a
lead byte, **the week's own start date**, seven day blocks of session codes, the schedule
name, and fourteen further bytes, so the record's length is 73 plus the name's. That length was
measured record by record against the next record's lead byte on every save: read four bytes
short, a record ends inside the next one, and the walk falls apart rather than quietly pairing
each name with the following week.

The library of saved schedules sits after the last block at no fixed distance, so it is the one
thing here found by shape: the run of bytes that precedes a group's entry count, followed by
entries that all decode. Nothing looks at any text to find it, and a section holding no such
run simply has no library.
