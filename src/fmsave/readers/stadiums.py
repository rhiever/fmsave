"""The stadium table in `game_db`, and the calendar link that says who plays where.

The table is a run of rows whose first field is the row's own place in it, counting from one.
That is what makes it findable: a pattern matching the words 1, 2 and 3 one row apart is
common enough to hit dozens of places in a section this size, so a hit counts only when a
dozen rows from there each store their own ordinal with the stadium uid written twice and a
zero byte after it. One candidate survived that on every save measured, and the head sits at no
fixed fraction of the section, so nothing here is a fixed offset.

The walk then steps row by row and stops at the first row that is not the next one. It never
resynchronises, deliberately: a walk that skipped over bytes it could not read would turn a
layout that had moved into a shorter, quietly wrong table instead of a visibly empty one. Two
row shapes exist, and one flag bit tells them apart: a row that carries its name inline is
longer by the name and the word holding its length.

The ordinal itself is never exposed. It is a position in a table, not an id the game shows,
and a save that added a row would renumber everything after it. What leaves this module is the
uid, which is the stored value plus one, the same convention club uids follow.

**No club record points at a ground.** The link this module builds instead is a vote over the
fixture calendar: the ground a club played most of its first-team home matches at is its home
ground, once the calendar records enough of them. Ownership is a separate, stored field, and
the two disagree for about three grounds in ten.
