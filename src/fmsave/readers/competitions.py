"""Competitions, collected from the stage table, and the editor database id of each.

The save has no competition table: a competition exists here because stages name it. One
`Competition` is built per distinct competition id the stage table carries, in ascending id.

The name is the one field no save can fill, because the game renders competition names from
its own installed database. A name therefore arrives only from a user-supplied map, and that
map is keyed on the **editor database id** rather than on the competition id, since the
database id is what every source outside the save is keyed on and is the same value on every
save. Recovering it is what this module adds: elsewhere in `game_db` the save writes records
that pair a stage-space entity id with its database id, and those records cover every entity
in that space, so the map they give is restricted to the ids the stage table calls
competitions and is never read as a list of competitions in its own right.

`CompetitionIndex.name_for` is the single lookup every other reader uses to denormalise a
`competition_name`, so no reader repeats the rule.
