"""Locating player records in `game_db`: the marker and completeness scans, and acceptance.

Player records are found by two scans: a fast marker anchor, and a slower completeness pass
over the region after the name pools that catches records the anchor scan misses. Results
from both passes are merged in ascending record-offset order into a private index,
`PlayerRecords`. `readers/players.py` decodes the records this module locates; it imports
from here, never the other way around.
