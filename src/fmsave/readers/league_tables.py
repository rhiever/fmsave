"""Live league tables, built from the blocks one span pass collected.

**The span holds each block several times over.** The copies agree in every field this reader
decodes -- the same team, the same five aggregates, the same match rows -- and differ only in
the 19 undecoded bytes stored in front of the block. About 45% of the blocks on every save
measured are such copies. Keeping them would put
one club in a table two, three or four times and invent standings no save holds, so they are
dropped on content before anything else happens, and how many were dropped is counted: a
reader that quietly stopped dropping them would pass every other check here.

**Each block stores its own place in its table**, in the first of those head bytes: the index
runs 0 to n-1 and starts again where the next table begins. That is the boundary between one
table and the next, and it is the save's own. The distance between blocks is not a boundary and
must not be used as one, because two adjacent tables sit as close together as the blocks inside
a single table: a 3,000-byte rule merged one group in six on the corpus, the managed club's own
20-club division among them, and numbered the joined rows 1 to 38 across the seam without any
check noticing.

Dropping the copies first is what keeps that index readable. A copy's stored index is not the
one the block it repeats carries, so a copy left inside a table breaks the run and splits the
table around it: on the corpus the kept blocks give hundreds to about a thousand tables, the
largest holding 36, while the same blocks undeduplicated shatter into several thousand. The
tables that survive are the right shape -- dozens of them are divisions whose clubs all play
each other twice -- and at most 0.3% still hold one club twice, where two adjacent tables
happen to chain their indexes.

Nothing in a table names its competition. It is voted for from the fixture calendar: the
competitions each member club plays in are tallied over the table, and the most covered one
names it if it covers at least half the members, so a competition one member of twelve plays in
never names the table. Several tables may name one competition, because a cup's group stage is
one competition with a table per group; the corpus holds about 800 tables against about 520
competitions, so reserving a competition for a single table would leave most tables unnamed. A
table the vote cannot settle keeps `competition_id` None and is still returned, which on the
corpus is about one table in a thousand.

**That headline overshoots the 85% the spec expects, and it must be read beside the shape of
the tables.** The vote settles almost every table on the saves measured, but a third to nearly
a half of tables hold a single block, and a one-block table meets the
half-the-members rule on a majority of one, so it resolves whatever the calendar says. Over the
tables of two blocks or more the share is 0.998 or better. That is the figure that
shows the vote is sound rather than merely permissive, and a minimum size for the vote is worth
weighing against it.

**Each match slot says which ground it was played at**, from the parity the save alternates
venue by: the even slots are the home ones. The calendar is what says so, and it says it again
on every save read. For each table whose every row's played count equals that club's played
calendar fixtures in the table's competition in exactly one season, each played slot is matched
to the meetings the calendar holds between those two clubs in that season; where one of them
has been played, or where the scores name one of them and only one, the calendar's own stored
home team gives the venue. Those slots are then compared with the parity's: all but about a
fifth of a percent agree on every save measured, against that same fifth of a percent had
the parity been the other way round. Out-of-step tables are left out, because a table that does
not account for a season is compared against the wrong meetings; over every table the agreement
falls to about 0.91.

Every join goes through an index another reader already built, and an id that does not resolve
leaves its fields empty and is counted rather than guessed.
