"""The people a club employs who are not players: the club lists, their contracts and objects.

A club record names some of its staff in three lists that follow its affiliated-team ids, but a
fifth of the people a save employs are in no list at all, the human manager among them. So this
reader works from two ends. It walks every club record's lists, and it makes one filtered pass
over `game_db` for contract records whose selector is a person rather than a player; a record
belongs to the person whose header sits in front of it, which is how a person with no listing is
found. The two populations are merged on (club, person), with a person an affiliate side lists
and its parent pays belonging to the parent, the same rule a player on a B team follows.

A person's object holds his abilities, a role-like byte, the preferences a staff profile shows
and his name block; where the object's ability block does not read, nothing from it is shipped.
The human manager's object is laid out differently and is megabytes long, so he is located from
the `humans` section and read on his own.
