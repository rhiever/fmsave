"""Reading the clubs run by the save's human managers.

The `humans` section names the first human manager by a selector: the manager's person id
plus 1. Two independent routes link that manager to a club:

- Route 1 finds the contract chain records in `game_db` that carry the selector, decodes each
  with `ContractDecoder.decode_chain_record`, and takes the club of the best record whose team
  resolves to a club and whose contract has not ended before the in-game date: one with a
  parsed tail first, then the latest end.
- Route 2 looks through the strings of `save_game_summary` for a club short name directly
  followed by that club's uid. The string that ends exactly where it starts is the manager
  name.

Route 1 is the primary answer and route 2 checks it. When neither route finds a club, for
example while the manager is between jobs, no managed club is listed. The manager's person uid
comes from the single person header in `game_db` that stores the person id followed by a
doubled uid.
