"""Competition rules and transfer windows, read from the span and from `game_db`.

**Competition rules come from the preamble blocks one span pass already collected**, so this
reader walks nothing of its own: it decodes, keys and counts what `SpanRecords.rules_blocks`
holds, and joins each block to a league table by where the save keeps it.

**A block's competition is its position in the span, not a field it stores.** The span
alternates rules blocks and table blocks, and the run of table blocks stored after a block is
the table that block's rules govern. Where that run holds exactly one league table's set of
clubs, and that table carries a competition the fixture calendar voted it, the row takes that
competition; otherwise it keeps none. On the saves measured that is 418, 288 and 445 of 672,
521 and 655 blocks, so 32% to 45% of rows carry no competition, and a run matching two tables
at once carries none rather than being resolved to either. The calendar corroborates the
alignment: 0.75, 0.78 and 0.75 of a linked block's dated rounds fall on a date its competition
plays a fixture on, against 0.58, 0.55 and 0.57 when each block is linked to the run stored
*before* it. It rests on the league-table vote, so a row's competition is exactly as strong as
`LeagueTable.competition_id` and no stronger.

**The tagged rules groups are not read.** The save's rules database does hold groups of squad
and financial rules -- a home-grown minimum, a maximum squad size, a salary cap, a wage-bill
percentage -- and a strict walk anchored on the wage-percentage tag does pin four of them per
save, identical in shape and count on all three saves measured. They are still not shipped,
for reasons that are measured rather than cautious:

- **nothing readable ties a group to a competition.** Seven routes were measured and recorded:
  counting groups against competitions, stages and tables; the run of tables after a group;
  the owning name record legacy used, whose ownership has no record boundary at all (the first
  range spans 5.2 MB); tagged competition references inside the owning range, which are small
  integers that hit some competition by chance about a third of the time; the four groups' own
  one-byte competition value, with the same objection; and the reverse lookup for the one
  division whose Rules screen was read in game, which finds 34 and 67 tagged references and
  none of them under the division's own rule set. The positional link the preamble blocks use
  does not carry over, because a group is not stored beside a table;
- **the content is database content**, byte for byte the same on every save of one installed
  database, so it says nothing about any career;
- none of the four groups carries a string of any kind, so there is no group name to return;
- none carries the value tag the squad-size rule was supposed to be read through, so that rule
  is not in them at all;
- the wider population the groups were meant to come from is not bounded: of 324 candidates
  for the home-grown tag, 116 do not sit at a record boundary at all and the rest fall into
  three unrelated shapes;
- and no displayed in-game label pins the meaning of any value the groups hold, so naming one
  would rest on another tool's guess rather than on evidence.

Walking from the description marker, which is the obvious route, decodes nothing: on both
saves all 1,707 strict walks from it stop before reaching any rules tag.

Transfer windows are read from the tagged stream below.

The rules database is written as a tagged stream: a run of
`<4-byte tag, byte-reversed><01><type><value>` records. A transfer window is one such run,
opening with its start-date sub-list and ending at its closing-time value.

**Why the closing time is what recognises a window.** The date tags a window uses are shared
by many kinds of record in this stream. On the saves measured 1,766 start-date sub-lists carry
a complete, in-range date pair and only 54 of them also carry a closing time, so accepting on
the dates alone would return every dated record the rules database holds. Acceptance is
structural throughout: the record carries no description of its own, and the description
strings elsewhere in the stream belong to other records, so nothing here reads text.

The walk is the strict one in `fmsave._scan`, which stops at the first byte that is not a
record rather than hunting for the next one. That is what keeps a layout that has moved
visibly empty instead of quietly short.

**The rules database stores its windows more than once.** Every window record the stream holds
is returned, which is more records than there are distinct windows: on the saves measured 54
records and 22 distinct windows. The repeats are neither a decode fault nor dropped here, since
dropping them would hide a change in what a save stores behind a number that never moved.
`fmsave.models.rules.TransferWindow` sets out what a repeated row means and what a caller can
do about it.
