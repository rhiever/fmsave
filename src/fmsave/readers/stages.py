"""The stage table near the end of `game_db`, and the joins it carries to competitions.

The table is a run of fixed-size rows sitting in the last stretch of `game_db`. A row stores
its stage id twice, which is what makes the table recognisable: the reader searches the tail
of the section for the first offset where a long chain of rows all decode, walks back to the
head of that chain, and then steps row by row. A row that does not decode is a gap, and the
walk scans forward one byte at a time for the next row that does, so it resynchronises without
ever guessing a stride.

Every offset, the stride, the chain length and the bounds come from the layout, derived once
per layout, so the walk itself reads no layout fields.
