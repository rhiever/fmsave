"""Locating unserved suspension entries in `game_db` and joining them to their players.

A suspension entry is a short fixed-size record carrying a byte signature (see
`SuspensionLayout`). `locate_suspensions` scans the player region, from just before the first
player record to the end of `game_db`, with a compiled regex that resumes one byte after every
match start, so signatures that overlap one another are all considered. It gives each entry to
its owning player by bisecting the sorted record offsets. The pattern, the field Struct, the
offsets and the bounds are derived from the layout once per layout, and checked for
consistency at that point, so the search loop never reads the layout.

An entry stores one id and one scope code that says what the id is. The layout lists which
codes name a competition and which name a nation, and every row built here reads the id
through the scope that gives it, so a nation id never reaches a competition field and a
competition id never reaches a nation one. The two really do share numbers inside one save,
so this is what keeps a ban from being named after an unrelated competition.
