"""Reading the injury-type names, and the injury history the save keeps against its people.

The names come out of a per-match file. No section of the save holds them: every per-match
directory entry carries one copy of the table, a few hundred bytes into its payload. The table
is found structurally and never by its text, because the names are in whatever language the
save was written in: a compiled seed pattern finds every place a record of the right shape
could start, each seed is walked as strictly as the layout allows, and the longest chain of
records is the table. Only as many entries are read as it takes to find one, so a save with
hundreds of them is never read whole.

The history comes out of a section of its own, walked whole: four arrays of fixed-stride rows,
three lists and an eight-byte tail, back to back with nothing between them. Nothing is searched
for and there is nothing to resynchronise on, so the walk itself is the structural check: a
count read one byte out of place claims either far more bytes than the section holds or too few
to reach the tail.
