    """How to locate and parse a player's contract chain in `game_db`.

    A chain record for pindex `x` at record start `record_offset` (next record start
    `next_record_offset`, or the end of `game_db` for the last record) is a hit of `tag`
    in `[record_offset + chain_window_start_offset, next_record_offset +
    chain_window_end_offset)` (the end of `game_db` for the last record's window) whose
    `u32` at `selector_offset` equals `x + 1`. Every other chain, tail, clause and head
    offset counts from the tag hit `M` (chain fields, `team_id_offset`, `wage_offset`) or
    from a tail start `E` (`tail_*`) or a clause-table base `base` (`clause_*`, `head_*`).

    The tail is found by trying `E = M - tail_base_offset - tail_step_bytes * event_count`
    for `event_count` from 0 to `tail_max_event_count`, accepted when the byte at
    `E + tail_sentinel_byte_offset` equals `tail_sentinel_byte_value` and the `u32` at
    `E + tail_sentinel_word_offset` equals `tail_sentinel_word_value` (`tail_sentinel_word_offset`
    is always `tail_sentinel_byte_offset + 1`, so the two sentinels form one contiguous
    signature) and the stored event count at `tail_event_count_offset` matches.

    A record whose tail does not parse is still preceded by a tail-shaped block, which is
    where a loan's dates and marker sit. That block is looked for the same way, without
    the sentinel checks and only up to `loan_block_max_event_count` steps back, and is
    accepted when the count byte at `tail_event_count_offset` matches the step and the end
    at `tail_end_offset` is a game date or the missing-date marker; its `tail_e24_offset`
    word marks a loan, and its `tail_printed_start_offset` date is the loan's start. A
    parsed tail stores a printed start date in the same place, which the contract fields
    take from the record itself instead, so the tail struct skips it.

    A clause table holds, from `base + clause_ff_offset`: an 8-byte marker
    (`clause_ff_count` bytes), `clause_zero_count` zero bytes, the clause count byte at
    `base + clause_count_offset`, and that many entries from `base + clause_entries_offset`,
    each `clause_entry_bytes` long. After the last entry come two bonus lists and a trailer:
    a competition count (`clause_competition_count_bytes` wide) and that many
    `clause_competition_item_bytes`-byte items, each starting with
    `clause_competition_item_prefix`; an award flag (`clause_award_flag_bytes` wide) that is 0
    for no award list, or 1 followed by an award count (`clause_award_count_bytes` wide) and
    that many `clause_award_item_bytes`-byte items, each starting with
    `clause_award_item_prefix`; then `clause_trailer_bytes` zero bytes, which end at `E`. With
    both lists empty, the bytes after the entries are `-clause_entries_offset` zero bytes.

    Once a tail is found, the clause table is looked for first by trying
    `base = E - clause_step_bytes * count` for `count` from 0 to `clause_max_count`, accepted
    when the marker is `FF` x `clause_ff_count` and the zero run and the count byte equal to
    `count` follow it: the position of a table whose bonus lists are empty. When that finds
    nothing, the table is taken to be the one nearest `E` whose entries, bonus lists (up to
    `clause_competition_max_count` competition items and `clause_award_max_count` award items)
    and trailer end exactly at `E`, whose zero run and count byte check, and whose marker is
    either `FF` x `clause_ff_count` or a `clause_team_marker_id_bytes`-byte team id that is
    neither all `FF` nor all zero, followed by zero bytes. The head fields are read only when
    the `u16` at
    `base + head_gate_offset` equals `head_gate_value`.

    The fallback reader walks `FF FF FF FF` hits in `[record_offset +
    fallback_start_from_record, limit)`, where `limit` is `max(record_offset +
    fallback_start_from_record, next_record_offset - fallback_end_margin)` (`next_record_offset`
    the end of `game_db` for the last record). For a hit at `i`, `j = i + 8`; when `j +
    fallback_gate_length <= limit` and the `fallback_nonzero_length` bytes at `j +
    fallback_nonzero_offset` are not all zero, an end date sits at `j +
    fallback_end_date_offset` and a start date at `j + fallback_start_date_offset`.

    Two further tests decide whether an accepted record is in scope, and they are not part of

    `list_entry_bytes`, each a u32 entry count and that many entries of that size, and last
    `tail`. The section ends on the tail's last byte, with nothing after it.
    `typed_array_index` and `log_array_index` say which two arrays carry the rows fmsave
    ships; the other two are walked and counted only.

    **The walk is the structural check.** Every count is judged against the bytes left before
    it is used, so a wrong start offset or a single wrong stride reads a count out of the
    middle of a row and fails on the first part that does not fit. There is no signature to
    search for and no way to resynchronise, which is why nothing here is a range or a cap.

    Inside a row, `lead_byte` sits at offset 0, the 4-byte date at `date_offset` and the u32
    person selector (the person's index plus one) at `selector_offset`. A log row carries a
    u32 team id at `log_team_offset` and the two coded bytes at `log_cause_offset` and
    `log_severity_offset`; a typed row carries a u16 injury type at `typed_type_offset` and
    two unnamed bytes at `typed_r11_offset` and `typed_r12_offset`.

    Both dates carry time-slot bits in the high bits of their first word, so they are decoded
    with `fmsave._scan.decode_date` rather than any validator that wants those bits clear.
    `typed_clock_band_days` is how far either side of the in-game date a typed row's date may
    sit before the check that judges those dates counts it as unsound, and `recent_log_days`
    how far back a log row counts as recent for the check that compares its team with the
    player's current one. The band is not a rule the game keeps to: it is wide enough to hold
    every dated typed row of every save measured with room to spare, and narrow enough that a
    date read from neighbouring bytes falls outside it.

    **The club lists.** From `ClubRecordSpan.team_list_end`, a club record holds a count byte
    and that many affiliated-team ids, and then exactly `list_count` staff lists, each its own
    count byte followed by that many u32 values, each a person id plus one. The bytes after the
    last list are other data and are never read as a fourth list. A club's lists are read only
    when they all end at or before the record's end and every value lies inside
    `list_value_range`, which no club of any save measured fails.

    **The person object.** `header` is the offset of the u32 person id. The uid sits twice, at
    `uid_offset` and `uid_copy_offset`, and `kind_offset` holds `staff_kind` for a staff member
    and `human_kind` for the human manager. `entry_count_offset` holds how many `entry_bytes`
    entries the object carries; they start two bytes later, behind a zero byte, and nothing
    reads either of those two positions. Three
    reputation words follow the entries, so the ability block starts at

        ability = header + ability_base_offset + entry_bytes * entry_count

    role-like byte at `r4_offset`, `code_count` bytes from `codes_offset`, the sentinel byte,
    `preference_count` preference slots from `preferences_offset`, and `block_40_count` further
    bytes from `block_40_offset`.

    An object carries a readable **ability signature** when both abilities lie inside
    `ability_range` and the sentinel byte equals `sentinel_value`. Without one, nothing read
    from the ability block is shipped: the block's position rests on the entry count, and an
    object whose signature does not read is an object whose position is not to be trusted. The
    human manager's object has no readable signature at all.

    `named_preference_slots` pairs each named preference with its slot;
    `unnamed_preference_slots` are the slots that ship as raw numbers, and

    every slot but the one holding a number outside `preference_range`.

    by one filtered pass over the section for the contract tag followed by a selector no larger
    than `discovery_selector_maximum` and a team id inside the contract layout's range. From a
    hit's tag the person's header is searched for backwards inside
    `contract_header_search_bytes`; the largest distance measured is 8,161 bytes.

class TacticsLayout:
    """Where the manager's team blocks sit in `tactics_man`, and how one tactic is laid out.

    **Header.** The byte at `header_marker_offset` is `header_marker`, the u32 at
    `selector_offset` is the human manager's own selector (his person id plus 1, the value
    `humans` stores) and the u32 at `block_count_offset` is how many team blocks follow from
    `first_block_offset`. The u16 in front of the marker is 1 on every save measured and is
    read by nothing: "the number of human managers" is a hypothesis with no second case to
    test, and a save with two humans is not in the corpus.

    **Team blocks.** One block per team of the managed club, in ascending team id, found by
    searching for the team's own id followed by `block_marker`; a team id those six bytes match
    at several places, or none, gets no block. A block starts with that id and marker, then a
    length-prefixed selection label, then `selection_slot_count` selector words, then
    `selection_end_marker`, two selector lists, `list_item_lead_byte` and one selector,
    `taker_marker`, `taker_list_count` lists, `order_marker`, `order_list_count` lists, a zero
    byte, the u32 the manager's choice of tactic may sit in (`no_tactics_value` on a block with
    no tactic) and the u16 count of tactic records. A selector list is a u32 count and that
    many `list_item_lead_byte` plus u32 pairs; nothing caps a count but the bytes left in the
    section, because one list of 99 selectors exists.

    **Tactic records** are bounded by the next signature, never by the walk: the bytes after a
    record's last slot block are not decoded, so the record after it starts at the next
    `user_signature` or `preset_signature` hit, and the count says how many to read. A record
    is its signature, a length-prefixed name within `name_length_range`, `name_zero_bytes`
    zero bytes, `team_instruction_bytes` instruction bytes of which `mentality_index` is the
    mentality code, a length-prefixed style label, `style_code_bytes` of style code, and then
    `slot_count` **pairs** of slot blocks: the in-possession block and then the
    out-of-possession block, which is the one carrying the extra per-position index byte. The
    22 blocks of a record are pairs and not two runs of eleven: walked as two runs the walk
    stops at the third block on every record of every save measured, and walked as pairs it
    completes on all of them with the index bytes a permutation of 0 to `slot_count` less one.

    **A slot block** is `slot_tag`, a u32 position mask whose bits 0 to `position_bit_count`
    less one are positions and whose higher bits are column flags, `slot_constant`, a u32
    count of setting units inside `unit_count_range`, `role_bits_bytes` of role bits, that many
    `unit_bytes` units and `trail_bytes` of trailing bits. A unit is `unit_lead`, a head byte,
    `unit_first_field_bytes` of one bit field, `unit_separator` and
    `unit_second_field_bytes` of another.

    **Set-piece routines** follow a block's tactic records. Each ends with a length-prefixed
    name inside `routine_name_length_range` and then `routine_terminator`, so they are found by
    searching the block for that terminator and decoding the name backwards from it: the
    smallest length whose stored u32 sits exactly that many bytes in front of the terminator and
    whose bytes are text. `routine_count` of them sit in every block of every save measured, and
    not one terminator falls inside a tactic record, including on the save whose style code is
    the terminator's own last four bytes. A routine's name is never matched against text: an
    unnamed slot stores a name of length zero.

class TrainingLayout:
    """Where the training calendars, mentoring groups and saved schedules sit in `training_man`.

    **The header.** The u32 at `header_count_offset` is how many `header_entry_bytes` entries
    the per-person list at `header_list_offset` holds. `header_gap_bytes` bytes then sit between
    that list and the first team block; they are not decoded. The first of them is the number of
    blocks that follow on every save measured, but whether it is one byte, two or three is not
    pinned, so nothing reads it and the block walk is judged by its own check instead.

    **A team block** is a u32 team id, the byte `block_lead_byte`, a u32 count of
    `block_entry_bytes` entries, each of which the walk requires to start with
    `block_entry_lead_byte` although nothing else in it is decoded, a u32 count of weekly
    records, those records, `block_tail_bytes` of tail (not decoded), a u32 count of mentoring
    groups, those groups, and the byte `block_terminator` -- except after the last block, which
    is followed by unrelated data. The walk reads a block only while the stored team id is a
    team of the managed club it has not already read, which is what ends it on the last block.

    **A weekly record** is the byte `week_lead_byte`, a 4-byte date at `week_date_offset`
    carrying time-of-day bits, the byte `week_marker_value` at `week_marker_offset`,
    `day_block_count` blocks of `day_block_bytes` at `day_blocks_offset` each starting
    `day_block_lead_byte` (session codes, not decoded), then at `week_name_offset` a u32 length
    of at most `longest_name_bytes` and that many text bytes. **The record is
    `week_record_fixed_bytes` plus that length**, so `week_trailer_bytes` follow the name:
    that length was measured on every record of every save by walking to the next record's lead
    byte, because reading it four bytes short lands a record's end inside the next one.

    The date comes **first**, before the name it belongs to, so a name pairs with the date
    written before it rather than with the following record's.

    **A mentoring group** is the byte `group_lead_byte`, a u32 group number, the byte
    `group_label_marker`, a u32 length and that many label bytes, then a u32 member count of at
    most `most_members_per_group` and that many u32 selectors, each a player's record index plus
    one. `most_members_per_group`, `longest_name_bytes` and `most_library_entries` are
    corruption caps and nothing more: each is far wider than anything a save measured holds (3
    members, 18 name bytes, 4 entries a group), and their one job is to stop a count read from
    the wrong bytes claiming megabytes. Tightening one to what a save holds today would be an
    unmeasured bound, so each is pinned by a test at its own boundary rather than by a saved
    figure.

    **The schedule library** sits somewhere after the last block, at no fixed distance from it
    or from the section's end, so it is found by shape. `library_group_prefix` is the run of
    bytes that sits immediately before a group's u32 entry count on every group of every save
    measured; a group is accepted only when its count is at most `most_library_entries` and
    every one of its entries decodes. An entry is `library_entry_lead_byte`, a u32
    `library_entry_word_value` at `library_entry_word_offset`, the byte
    `library_entry_marker_value` at `library_entry_marker_offset`, `day_block_count` day blocks
    at `library_day_blocks_offset`, then at `library_folder_offset` a folder name, a u32
    schedule id and a schedule name.

    `seven_day_step` is how many days apart consecutive weeks are, which the reader counts.

class GateBounds:
    """Loose bounds for the reader checks on what the `game_db` readers decode.

    Each `BoundPair` is an inclusive `(minimum, maximum)` pair; None leaves that side open.
    Rates are shares from 0 to 1, and the other bounds are counts or medians. The checks apply
    only when `game_db` is at least `minimum_applies_from_bytes` long, because smaller sections
    come from fragments that cannot meet full-save counts; the checks on what the span pass
    reads apply only from `span_minimum_applies_from_bytes` of decompressed span, for the same
    reason.

    The readers count values inside these inclusive ranges: `height_range_cm` (heights),
    `age_range_years` (known ages), `home_reputation_window` (the largest difference between
    home and current reputation counted as near), `condition_sharpness_maximum` (the
    largest condition and match sharpness on their stored scale), `natural_goalkeeper_rating`
    (the lowest goalkeeper rating that marks a natural goalkeeper, left out of the outfield
    count) and `goalkeeper_block_low_maximum` (the highest raw handling and raw throwing counted
    as low).

    Players: `players_minimum` (records), `person_blocks` (records with a person block),
    `names_resolved` (of person blocks), `relation_sentinel` (relation entries ending in the
    sentinel byte), `second_nation_qualifier` (second-nation entries with a known qualifier),
    `handling_above_finishing` (all records), `outfield_goalkeeper_block_low` (outfield
    players whose raw handling and raw throwing are both low, of outfield players),
    `with_natural_position`, `height_in_range`,
    `height_median`, `age_median`, `aged_in_range` (of known ages),
    `condition_sharpness_in_range`, `join_date_valid`, `world_not_above_current`,
    `home_near_current`, `team_resolved` (of players with a team) and
    `home_grown_club_refs_resolved` (of home-grown club references).

    Contracts: `players_with_chain` (of players), `no_contract_in_effect` (players whose
    chain records all start after the in-game date, of players with a chain),
    `date_marked_chain_records` (chain records
    found by a date in their tag slot, of chain records), `tails_parsed` (of chain records),
    `tails_without_clause_table` (parsed tails where no clause table is found, of parsed tails),
    `clause_terminator` (clause tables whose bonus lists and zero trailer end exactly at the
    tail start, of clause tables), `contract_head` (of clause tables), `past_dated_tail_ends`
    (of parsed tails with an end date) and `chain_teams_resolved` (of chain records). Only
    tables found by the first search can fail `clause_terminator`, since the search that works
    back from the tail accepts a table only when it ends there; a table that search cannot find
    at all counts towards `tails_without_clause_table` instead, so the two together cover every
    way a clause table can go missing or stop short.

    Clubs: `clubs_minimum` (records), `team_lists_found` and `status_normal` (of clubs),
    `status_confirmation` (of normal status records), `affiliate_lists_found` (club records
    holding an affiliated-team list, of club records), `affiliate_teams_linked` (listed
    affiliate teams that belong to one other club, of listed affiliate teams),
    `reputation_found` (clubs whose status record held a reputation inside the layout's
    range, of club records) and `reputation_median` (the low median of those reputations).
    `affiliate_teams_linked` is not applied when no club lists a team, so
    `affiliate_lists_found` is what fails when the affiliate decode finds nothing at all. The
    reputation pair is what fails when the reputation moves inside the status record: read a
    byte out, most clubs hold no readable reputation at all and the median of the rest climbs
    far above its band, so either bound catches the shift on its own.

    Suspensions: `suspension_share_of_players` (players with an entry, of players),
    `issued_after_clock` (entries issued after the in-game date, of entries) and
    `suspension_scopes_known` (entries whose scope code the layout lists, of entries). The
    first two apply whenever the section is large enough, so a search that finds no entry
    fails the first on its lower bound and the second for want of a rate;
    `suspension_scopes_known` judges the entries that were found, so it is not applied when
    there are none.

    Stages: `stage_rows_minimum` (rows walked), `stage_walk_gaps` (places the walk had to
    resynchronise), `stage_ids_ascending` (steps that reached a higher stage id, of steps),
    `stage_rows_with_competition` (of rows), `stage_trailing_sentinel` (rows whose last word
    is the missing value, of rows) and `stage_table_tail_bytes` (bytes of `game_db` after the
    table, which is near its end).

    Competitions: `competitions_minimum` (distinct competitions the stage table names),
    `competition_database_ids_mapped` (competitions the id-pair records give a database id, of
    competitions), `competition_database_id_conflicts` (competitions dropped because another
    competition claims the same database id, of competitions) and
    `competition_names_within_database_ids` (competitions a user-supplied name map named, of
    competitions that have a database id). There is no lower bound on competitions named,
    because no save stores a competition name and the share is zero until a reader supplies a
    map; the upper bound is what holds a name to the only key it may arrive through.

    Fixtures: `fixtures_minimum` (records in the run kept as the calendar),
    `fixture_cluster_share` (that run, of every fixture record in the span),
    `fixture_strays_minimum` (records the span holds outside that run),
    `fixture_stage_resolved` (kept records whose stage the stage table holds, of kept records
    naming a stage) and `fixture_teams_resolved` (team ids a club lists, of the two per kept
    record). These five are judged against the span rather than `game_db`, so they apply from
    `span_minimum_applies_from_bytes`. A span pass that finds no fixture at all fails the
    first two on their lower bounds and leaves the other three without a rate, so a calendar
    layout that has moved fails here rather than reporting a career with no matches.

    The share and the stray count bound the same split from opposite sides. The share falls
    when the calendar shatters into fragments; the stray count falls to zero when nothing is
    separated from the calendar at all, which the share cannot see, because a reader that kept
    every stray copy scores a perfect 1.0 on it.

    Stage-keyed results: `result_records_minimum` (records accepted in the regions scanned),
    `results_joined` (accepted records that found a fixture on their date and two team ids, of
    accepted records) and `results_for_unplayed` (records whose one fixture is not marked
    played, of joined records). These judge the same pass the calendar does, so they apply from
    `span_minimum_applies_from_bytes` alongside the fixture bounds.

    `results_joined` is the one that says the record shape is still being read correctly. The
    records are found by one locator and the calendar by an entirely different one, in another
    region, so a decode that has moved stops matching a calendar it never shared an offset
    with: joining on a key wrong by a single day, or with the two sides swapped, was measured at
    zero joins. The bound is a floor under a rate observed near 0.97, low enough that a career
    holding more unjoinable history clears it.

    Transfer windows: `transfer_windows_minimum` (windows decoded) and `transfer_window_dates`
    (windows whose two date groups both decoded inside their ranges, of the records that
    carried a closing time). Windows are database content rather than career state, so both
    bounds rest on **one** installed database and are kept loose: a database with
    fewer nations loaded legitimately carries fewer windows. A decode that finds nothing fails
    the count on its lower bound, and one that has moved only inside the date groups leaves
    the count alone and drops the share instead.

    League tables: `table_blocks_minimum` (blocks left after repeated content is dropped),
    `table_block_duplicates_minimum` (blocks dropped as repeats),
    `table_block_team_in_range` (of the blocks kept), `table_groups_resolved` (of groups),
    `double_round_robin_divisions` (groups shaped like a division whose clubs play each other
    twice) and `table_venue_calendar_agreement` (slots whose venue the calendar decides and
    the slot parity names the same way, of the slots the calendar decides). These judge the
    span pass, so they apply from `span_minimum_applies_from_bytes`.

    `table_venue_calendar_agreement` is what keeps the slot parity honest, and it is the one
    league-table gate an empty population leaves unjudged rather than failed: a layout that
    settles no parity decides nothing, and so does a career whose tables are all out of step
    with its calendar, which is a fact about the save. The count gates beside it are what fail
    when the table decode itself has found nothing.

    Competition rules: `rules_markers_minimum` (rules preamble blocks the span pass judged),
    `rules_fully_parsed` (of those blocks), `rules_linked_blocks_minimum` (blocks whose
    following run of table blocks is exactly one league table with a competition of its own)
    and `rules_link_round_dates` (dated rounds falling on a date the linked competition plays a
    fixture on, of the dated rounds linked blocks hold). These judge the span pass, so they
    apply from `span_minimum_applies_from_bytes`.
    `rules_fully_parsed` counts the **strict** sense of a
    parsed block, the one `RawRulesBlock.fully_parsed` carries: the promotion quad written
    twice identically and the tie-break list, the prize list and every round record decoded.
    A count that ignored the quad would sit about ten points higher, so this floor must not be
    read against a figure measured the other way. A marker search that has moved finds nothing
    and fails the count on its floor; a body decode that has moved keeps the markers and drops
    the share instead, so the two fail on different faults.

    The last two judge the positional competition link, and the pair is deliberate: **one is a
    count precisely because no share of this link can fail when it stops linking.** The
    misalignment a share could catch is taking the table run before a block instead of the run
    after it, and that permutes the same runs among the same blocks, so every share built from
    the link is invariant under it by construction: the share of blocks that link at all is
    0.55 to 0.68 whichever run is taken. `rules_link_round_dates` escapes that because it is a
    share of *round dates* rather than of blocks, and it separates cleanly (0.74 to 0.78
    against 0.55 to 0.58) -- but it is a share with no population of its own to fall back on,
    so the empty-population rule leaves it unjudged when nothing links at all. `rules_linked_blocks_minimum` is what
    closes that hole: a link that quietly stops linking scores zero on it, which no share here
    would notice. It applies only above `rules_link_minimum_applies_from_runs` blocks with a
    run, so a save holding few divisions is not held to a count measured on saves holding many.

    A third measure was dropped rather than shipped: the round-count shape separates only from
    0.62 to 0.64, a window two points wide, which is too little to rest a bound on given the
    saves tested, and the round dates already judge the same alignment with room to spare. It
    ships as an anomaly count.

    The duplicate floor is what fails when the deduplication stops deduplicating. Every save
    measured repeats about 45% of its table blocks, so the count is always in the thousands and
    a floor cannot trouble a healthy save; a reader that kept every copy would score zero on it
    while passing everything else, because the copies are real blocks with sound arithmetic.
    The division count is what fails when the grouping stops separating one table from the
    next: the copies pad the gaps between tables, so grouping them ungrouped collapses dozens
    of tables into one run that is division shaped no longer. Neither failure is visible to
    `table_groups_resolved`, which a single huge group scores 1.0 on.

    Per-match player stats: `per_match_competition_in_stage_space` (records whose competition id
    the stage table names, of records) and `per_match_minutes_in_range` and
    `per_match_rating_in_range` (records with a body whose minutes and whose stored rating are
    at most the layout's maximum, of records with a body). There is deliberately **no** count
    bound: the search is held to a window of years around the save's own clock, so the number of
    records moves with the window and with how long the career has run rather than with the
    layout, and a bound on it would say nothing. The three shares judge each record's shape
    instead, and all three apply whenever the section is large enough, so a search that finds
    nothing leaves every one of them without a denominator and fails here rather than reporting
    a career whose players have played no matches.

    Stadiums: `stadium_rows_minimum` (rows walked), `stadium_pitch_within_limits` (rows whose
    pitch length is inside the layout's range and inside their own stored minimum and maximum
    for both length and width, of the rows that are not the template the table ends with),
    `stadium_owners_resolved` (of rows naming an owning club), `stadium_capacity_within_all_seater`
    (of all rows) and `stadium_home_grounds_owned` (clubs whose calendar home ground is a ground
    they own, of the clubs that own a ground and have a calendar home ground). The four shares
    apply only where their own population is not empty, since a table of grounds no club owns,
    or a career whose calendar gives no club a home ground, is a fact about the save; the row
    count is what fails when the walk finds nothing.

    Stadium joins: `fixture_stadiums_resolved` (kept fixtures whose stored ground the stadium
    table holds, of kept fixtures storing one) judges the fixture reader, so it applies from
    `span_minimum_applies_from_bytes` alongside the other fixture bounds, and only when some
    fixture stores a ground. Its floor sits deliberately above the share a table that lost its
    named tail resolves at, which is the one misalignment this join has: a floor low enough to
    let that control pass would be a check that cannot fail.

    Injury types: `injury_type_entries_minimum` (records of the name table read out of a
    per-match entry). It applies only on a full-size `game_db` **and** when the save lists at
    least one per-match entry, because a save listing none holds these names nowhere at all,
    which is a fact about the save rather than a layout that has moved. The floor sits far
    below the 93 records every save measured carries: what it catches is a record shape read
    from the wrong offset, which decodes a handful of records at most before its chain breaks.
    Injury history: `injury_log_lead_byte`,
    `injury_log_dates` (rows whose date decodes and is on or before the in-game date) and
    `injury_log_teams_resolved` (rows whose team id a club lists), all as shares of the log
    rows; `injury_log_ascending` (steps from one dated row to the next that did not reach an
    earlier date, of those steps); `injury_log_recent_team_matches` (recent rows whose stored
    team is the player's current team, of recent rows whose player resolves and has a team);
    `injury_typed_lead_byte`, `injury_typed_dates_near_clock` (rows whose date decodes **and**
    lands within `typed_clock_band_days` of the in-game date) and
    `injury_typed_types_resolved` (rows
    whose injury type the name table holds), all as shares of the typed rows. They apply from
    `injury_manager_minimum_applies_from_bytes` of decompressed section, because the checks
    judge full-save counts and a fragment carries none.

    The walk itself is the structural check and it raises rather than scoring: a start or a
    stride read wrong cannot consume the section exactly. What these shares add is a judgement
    of each row's own shape, and each one separates a sound decode from the same rows read one
    or four bytes late: the lead byte falls to at most 0.012, the dated-and-near-the-clock
    share to zero and the injury types to zero, teams to at most 0.21, and the ascending share
    to at most 0.82. `injury_log_recent_team_matches` is the one join to a table read from
    another section entirely, and putting a random player in place of the stored one scores at
    most 0.0003 on it. `injury_log_ascending` is judged on the steps between dated rows and is
    deliberately **not** excused when there are no such steps: a section holding ten thousand
    log rows from which not one date decodes is what a decode read one byte out looks like, so
    it fails there for want of a rate.

    `injury_typed_dates_near_clock` counts over **every** typed row rather than over the dated
    ones, and that denominator is the whole reason it can fail. Over the dated rows the share
    is 1.0 read correctly and 1.0 read one byte late too, because the handful of dates that
    still decode there land near the clock as well; over every typed row it falls from 0.988
    to 0.0. It subsumes a plain check on how many rows carry a date and catches what that
    check cannot: a date read from neighbouring bytes that decodes to a year the game has
    long passed, which is where every date that still decodes one byte late lands.

    What the band does **not** claim is a retention rule. How far behind the in-game date a
    typed row may sit is career state, not layout: on seven save states measured the oldest
    dated typed row was seven days behind the clock on five of them and eight days behind on
    the other two, with a full day's worth of rows at that age rather than a remnant, so a
    bound drawn tight around either figure fails a save the reader reads correctly. The band
    is `typed_clock_band_days` either side of the clock instead: 2.7 times the widest
    deviation measured (66 days, ahead of the clock), while every date read one byte late
    lands more than a thousand days away. The counts behind the tail are reported as
    anomalies.

    One counted share carries no gate: how many log rows still name a player is 0.94 to 0.96,
    and it is career state rather than layout, since a person the save no longer keeps as a
    player is a real row the game still shows. It is reported as an anomaly instead.

    Club finances: `finance_net_identity` (rows whose net equals total income less total
    expenditure, of rows), `finance_balance_continuity` (consecutive row pairs where the later
    balance is the earlier one plus the later month's net, of such pairs),
    `finance_expenditure_split` (rows whose expenditure excluding transfers lies between zero
    and the total, of rows), `finance_clubs_with_two_chains` (clubs holding a second snapshot
    chain), `finance_series_minimum` (clubs with a series) and, in `sponsorships()`,
    `finance_clubs_with_sponsors` (clubs with a sponsor run, of clubs with a series) and
    `sponsor_clubs_minimum` (clubs with a sponsor run).

    Only some of a save's clubs keep a finance series at all -- those of the one or two league
    nations the save tracks, which changes during a career -- so `finance_series_minimum` bounds
    it at one and applies only where a managed club exists, whose club held a series on every
    save measured. The three shares and the sponsor share each apply only where they have a
    denominator, because a save whose clubs keep no series is a save with nothing to judge
    rather than a broken decode; the series floor is what catches a locator that has stopped
    finding chains, and on a save with no human manager nothing does.

    `sponsor_clubs_minimum` is the sponsor share's own numerator judged without a denominator,
    and it is what keeps `sponsorships()` from reporting an empty table as sound: the share
    counts against the clubs the finance locator found, so a break of that locator leaves it
    with nothing to divide by and reported as not applied. The floor applies where a managed
    club exists, as the series floor does, and it never fires alone on a sound decode, since a
    save with a series but no sponsor run fails the share first.

    Club facilities: `facility_byte_in_range` (clubs whose rating lies inside the layout's
    range, of clubs with a finance series) and `facility_clubs_minimum` (clubs with a rating).
    The share applies only where a club has a series, as the finance shares do, and the count
    floor applies only where the save lists a managed club, whose own club held a series on
    every save measured. The share is what catches a rating read from the wrong offset: the
    byte one before the rating reads inside the range on at most 0.02 of the clubs, the byte
    one after on at most 0.09, and four bytes after -- the worst control measured -- on at
    most 0.63, all far below the floor.

    Affiliate groups: `affiliate_members_resolved` (group members the public club index names,
    of group members). It applies on a full-size `game_db` **and** only when a group holds a
    member at all, because a save whose section stores no group has no member to resolve and
    an empty population is not a failure. What it catches is the index space: read one index
    out and the share falls from 0.9836 to 0.859.

    Job vacancies: `job_vacancy_tag` (records carrying the record tag), `job_vacancy_dates_ordered`
    (records whose advertised date is on or before the in-game date and whose second date is on
    or after the advertised one), `job_vacancy_advertised_ascending` (steps from one record's
    advertised date to the next that did not go backwards, of those steps),
    `job_vacancy_reserved_zero` (records whose two reserved fields are both zero), all as shares
    of the records read. They apply from `job_vacancy_minimum_applies_from_records` records,
    which is what leaves a legitimately short or empty feed alone: the feed is career state, a
    manager between jobs may see very little of it, and no floor under its size could tell a
    quiet job market from a layout that has moved. The structural size identity in
    `JobCentreLayout` is what catches a start shifted by a whole record, which every share here
    passes. There is no gate on how many team ids resolve: ids are about 92% dense over the
    range the feed uses, so that share cannot fail. There is none on how many competition ids
    the stage table names either: it is 1.0 read correctly **and** 1.0 with the record start
    shifted four bytes on every save measured, so it cannot fail.

    Staff: `staff_lists_fit` (club records whose affiliated-team list and three staff lists end
    inside the record with every value in range, of club records carrying a team list) and
    `staff_list_ids_are_staff` (listed people whose header is a staff object with a name block,
    of listed people), both in `staff_lists()`; and in `staff()` `staff_ability_signature`,
    `staff_preference_slots`, `staff_codes_in_set` and `staff_block_40_in_range`, each of the
    staff objects the rows were built from, `staff_person_blocks` (people with a name block, of
    people), `staff_minimum` (people), `staff_listed_contracted_here` (listed pairs whose
    person holds a contract at the listing club or at its parent, of listed pairs) and
    `staff_unowned_tailed_contracts` (contract records with a tail whose person has no header
    in front of them).

    The four object shares apply only where a staff object was read, and the block share and
    the count floor only on a full-size `game_db`; the list shares apply only where a club
    record carries a team list and where a club lists somebody. Each separates a sound read
    from a wrong one under a different misalignment: the fit share fails on a list start read
    one or four bytes late, the id share on a start read one byte early, the four object shares
    on an ability block read one byte either way or four bytes late or on the entry count read
    one byte late, the block share on a name-block window that starts past the block, and the
    unowned count on a kind byte read one byte out. `staff_block_40_in_range` holds at 1.0 with
    the ability block read one byte early, which the three shares beside it catch instead.

    Tactics: `tactics_manager_selector_matches` (1 when the section header names the same human
    manager as `humans`), `tactics_team_blocks_match_club` (blocks found, of the managed club's
    teams, and 0 when the header claims a different number of blocks),
    `tactic_slot_walks_complete` and `tactic_oop_index_permutations` (user tactic records whose
    22 slot blocks walked, and whose out-of-possession index bytes are a permutation, of user
    tactic records), `tactic_selection_selectors_resolved` (selectors the player records name,
    of selectors) and `tactic_selection_selectors_at_club` (of those, the ones at the managed
    club); in `set_pieces()`, `set_piece_blocks_with_twenty` (blocks holding exactly
    `TacticsLayout.routine_count` routines, of blocks). They apply on a full-size `game_db` and
    only where the save lists a managed club, because a manager between jobs has no team block
    to read and an empty result is a fact about the career.

    The two walk shares are judged on the user tactic records, and they are deliberately **not**
    excused when there are none: a managed club whose blocks hold no readable tactic record is
    what a signature that has moved looks like. The two selector shares and the routine share
    are excused without a denominator, since a block legitimately stores no selection at all.
    Mentality in 1 to 7 is **not** a gate: instruction byte 3 is 6 on every record of every save
    measured, so a record read one byte late passes it.

    Training and mentoring: `training_blocks_match_club_teams` (blocks walked, of the managed
    club's teams), `training_week_steps` (steps from one week to the next that step seven days,
    of those steps) and `mentoring_members_at_club` (group members whose own club is the managed
    club, of the members that resolve to a player). All three apply on a full-size `game_db`
    where the save lists a managed club, since a save with no manager has no calendar to read.

    Only the first is applied whatever the walk found, because its denominator is the club's own
    team count: it is what fails when the block walk has moved, since a shifted walk parses no
    block at all. The other two judge what was read and are not applied on an empty population,
    which is what a club whose teams hold one week or fewer, and a manager who mentors nobody,
    legitimately look like; every save measured has teams with no mentoring group.

    There is **no** check on how many members resolve to a player: the player index is dense
    over the range a squad occupies, so a selector read one too high still resolves most or all
    members on every save measured, and no floor separates that from the 1.0 a correct read
    scores. `mentoring_members_at_club` is what catches that read instead, because the players
    it wrongly resolves to belong to other clubs: the share falls to at most 0.18.
