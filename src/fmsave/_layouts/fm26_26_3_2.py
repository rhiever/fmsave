# A monthly finance snapshot row is 49 bytes and the row count sits in the four bytes in front

# measured, so searching only records of 1,500 bytes or more loses no club and skips most of
# them. The balance range and the weekly ceiling are far outside anything a club holds (the
# largest weekly wage budget measured is a small fraction of 20 million) and are there to reject
# look-alike bytes rather than to bound a real value.
#
# A career saved on its first days keeps a single month per club, which the count range alone
# cannot tell from a stray tag byte, so one or two rows are accepted only where they balance,
# money moves in at least one of them, and no longer chain is in the record. On the saves
# measured every short chain accepted this way holds the same months and values that a later
# save of the same career reads as a full chain; the two stand-alone short chains that
# balanced on long careers without being real were a row of zeros and a row whose income
# excluding transfers exceeded its total, which these tests reject.
