"""The registry of field statuses: whether each public field's meaning is verified.

A status belongs to the class that declares the field. A field whose type is another record
class (optionally with None) is a group: its values flatten into the parent's columns, it has no
status of its own, and its fields are registered on the group's class. field_status resolves a
dotted path such as "ability.current" through the group's class.

Every field that uses the same group class shares that class's statuses, so groups whose
statuses can differ must be separate classes. A tuple of records is an ordinary field of the
parent; the element class registers its own fields.
