"""Competitions and the stages they are played in.

A competition is played as a sequence of stages: a league season is one stage, a cup is one
stage per round, and a two-legged tie is two stages sharing one round code rather than one
stage with a leg number. The stage table is the only route from a fixture, a league-table
group or a per-match record to a competition, so a stage id is the key every competition join
goes through.

Competition ids here belong to the stage id space. They do **not** join to
`Suspension.suspension_competition_id`, which belongs to a separate suspension id space.

The save stores no competition name table: the game renders competition names from its own
installed database, so `Competition.name` and every denormalised `competition_name` stay None
unless a name map is supplied.

    across from a neighbouring code, because a wrong name is silently wrong while a raw
    number is plainly incomplete. Most codes a save uses are therefore UNKNOWN, among them
    the codes group stages and the qualifying rounds use.

    A stage with no round at all reads as None rather than UNKNOWN: a league matchday and a
