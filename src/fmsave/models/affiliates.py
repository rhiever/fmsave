"""Affiliate groups: the sets of clubs the save stores together.

**What groups a set of clubs is not established.** The save stores these groups in a section of
their own, with nothing in them that says what the grouping means, and every club field here is
`unconfirmed` for that reason.

**It is not the affiliate list a club's own Affiliated Clubs screen shows.** A screen settled
that: the club whose screen listed 26 affiliates belongs to no group here at all, and the one
group naming a club that screen also names pairs that club with its own academy rather than
with the club doing the viewing. Two of that screen's rows are the parent link
`Club.parent_club_uid` already carries, and the rest are in no field fmsave reads, so neither
a club's affiliates nor the kind of each affiliation is available here.

What the grouping is remains unknown. The largest group of every save measured is recognisably
a multi-club ownership group and many two-member groups pair a club with its own lower side,
which would suit an ownership or parent-company reading, but no screen has said so and a
recognisable group is not a displayed label.

This is **not** the parent link `Club.parent_club_uid` carries. That link comes from the
affiliated-team lists inside the club records, and not one of its thousand-odd pairs is a pair
these groups hold: the two describe different relations and neither is derived from the other.
