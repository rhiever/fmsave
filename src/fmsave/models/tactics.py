"""The manager's tactics and set-piece routines, as the save stores them per team.

**A tactic belongs to a team, not to a club.** The save keeps a separate copy of each tactic
for each team that uses it, so a manager with two tactics and two teams using them has four
records, and the copies are not byte-identical. A row here is one stored copy, keyed on the
team and the tactic's place in that team's own list, and the same tactic name appears once per
team.

**Almost nothing here has a name yet.** The mentality code, the position bits, the 19 team
instruction bytes and the 24-byte setting units are all read from offsets that are pinned by
measurement, but no displayed label has been matched to one of those codes, so every coded
label is `UNKNOWN` and every unnamed number ships raw. The position bits do agree with the
natural positions of the players picked in each slot, which is a corroboration against another
decoded field rather than a displayed formation, so it names no bit.
