"""Unserved suspensions: bans a player has been given and has not yet served.

The save keeps a player's suspension only while it is unserved. Every unserved ban it holds is
listed here, including bans the game no longer displays; the save stores no flag that tells
those apart, and why the game stops displaying one is not confirmed.

A ban stores one id and one scope code that says what the id refers to. A ban on one
competition stores a competition id in the **stage** id space, the same space `stages()`,
`competitions()`, `fixtures()`, `league_tables()` and `player_match_stats()` use, so it joins
to all of them. A nation-wide ban stores a **nation** id instead. The two are told apart here
rather than by the caller: `competition_id` is None on a nation-wide ban and `nation_id` is
None on a ban covering one competition, so neither can be read as the other.

# measurement over several saves settles all four. Every ban whose scope code is 1 stores a
# number the save's own competition table holds, and wherever the fixture calendar can test
# it, the player's club played that very competition on the day the ban was issued - against
# a shuffled control that scores near nothing, and with every exception a ban old enough for
# the player to have changed club since. A ban whose code is 5, 6 or 10 never passes that
# test and instead stores a nation the player or his club holds, which no code-1 ban ever
# does. So the code selects the id space, and neither reading survives being applied to the
# other group. What separates codes 5, 6 and 10 from one another is still unmeasured, which
# is why the code itself ships beside the scope.
