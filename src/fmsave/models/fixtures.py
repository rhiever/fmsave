"""The fixture calendar: every match a save has scheduled, played or left unplayed.

A fixture joins to its competition through its **stage**, so `competition_id` here belongs to
the stage id space, like every other competition id fmsave reports, and not to the id space a
suspension's competition id belongs to. A stage the stage table does not hold leaves the
competition fields empty rather than guessing them.

The save stores no competition name, so `competition_name` is None unless a name map was
supplied to `fmsave.open`, and then only for competitions whose editor database id resolves.

Derived views the calendar carries no field for:

- a club's own fixture list is `where(home_club_uid=...)` or `where(away_club_uid=...)`, or
  `filter(...)` for both at once; the home and away fields then say which side it was;
- a matchday is `round_index + 1`, since the stored index counts from zero;
- a season by date uses a 1 July boundary, which is not the same as `season_start_year`: that
  field is what the record stores, and it is None on some friendlies;
- a youth or reserve side is `away_club_short_name` together with `away_team_slot`. fmsave
  never builds a localised "B team" or "U21" name of its own, because the save holds none.

class Fixture:
    """One match in the save's fixture calendar.

    Attributes:
        stage_id: The stage this match belongs to, which is the only route to its
            competition; None when the record stores no stage.
        competition_id: Id of the competition, in the **stage** id space (not the id space a
            suspension's competition id belongs to), reached through the stage; None when the
            record has no stage, the stage is not in the stage table, or the stage names no
            competition.
        competition_name: Denormalised name of competition_id, which is None unless a name
            map is supplied, because the save stores no competition names (unconfirmed).
        round: The stage's round, or None when the match has no stage or its stage carries no
            round, as a league matchday and a league phase do not. Codes with no confirmed
            meaning keep their raw number and are labelled UNKNOWN.
        round_index: The match's zero-based index within its round, so a matchday is this
            plus one; None when the record stores the no-round value.
        date: The kick-off date, or None when the stored date does not decode.
        kick_off_time: The kick-off time of day, or None when the stored slot does not land
            inside a day.
        season_start_year: The calendar year the season started in, or None when the record
            stores none, as some friendlies do.
        home_team_id: The home side's team id, exactly as stored.
        home_club_uid: Uid of the club fielding the home team, or None when no club lists
            that team.
        home_club_name: Denormalised name of home_club_uid, or None when the team does not
            resolve.
        home_club_short_name: Denormalised short name of home_club_uid, or None when the team
            does not resolve.
        home_team_slot: The home team's slot in its club's team list, 0 for the first entry,
            or None when the team does not resolve.
        away_team_id: The away side's team id, exactly as stored.
        away_club_uid: Uid of the club fielding the away team, or None when no club lists
            that team.
        away_club_name: Denormalised name of away_club_uid, or None when the team does not
            resolve.
        away_club_short_name: Denormalised short name of away_club_uid, or None when the team
            does not resolve.
        away_team_slot: The away team's slot in its club's team list, 0 for the first entry,
            or None when the team does not resolve.
        home_goals: Goals the home side scored, or None when the save no longer holds the
            score. A played match with no goals means the score was not retained, not that
            the match finished goalless. The calendar itself stores no score: it is read from
            separate records the save keeps for only part of a career, so about a quarter of
            played matches carry one.
        away_goals: Goals the away side scored, or None when the save no longer holds the
            score, as for home_goals.
        played: Whether the save marks the match as played.
        is_neutral_venue: Whether the match was played away from the home club's usual
            ground: True when its ground differs from the one that club used most in this
            season, False when it matches, and None when the ground is unknown or the club
            played too few home matches this season to say which ground is usual. The season
            is the stored season_start_year, which some friendlies leave empty, and every
            such match a club played shares one vote; a club that moved ground mid-career
            therefore has its earlier seasonless matches judged against the later ground.
        match_record_id: Id of the match record the save keeps for a played match, or None
            when the match is unplayed (unconfirmed).
        match_rules_template: The three bytes naming the shared match-rules template this
            match uses. It is a template many competitions share and is **never** a
            competition id (unconfirmed).
        unknown: Numeric fields with no known meaning. "result_r22" is the byte stored beside
            the score, so only a match whose score the save still holds carries one
            (unconfirmed).
