"""Open jobs: the vacancies the save's job-centre feed holds.

**The feed keeps old rows.** The earliest advertised date on the saves measured is about ten
years before the in-game date, so a row here is a vacancy the save still remembers rather than
one the game would list today. Nothing in a row says whether it has been filled.

A vacancy is keyed on a team rather than a club, so `team_id` is what the save stores and the
club fields come from the club that fields that team. A row's role, its second date and two
further numbers have no confirmed meaning and ship in `unknown`.

        league_position: The team's current position in that competition's table, None where
