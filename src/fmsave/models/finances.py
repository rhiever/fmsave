"""Club money: one row per club per month, and the sponsor contracts a club holds.

**Money is a whole number in the save's base currency, which is not the currency the game
displays.** One save's screens were read against its own stored values and every figure came
out at the same rate: the balance, the transfer and wage budgets, the wage bill and the
month's income and expenditure all display at about 1.157 times what is stored, the one rate
fitting each of them. A single rate across every money field of a career is what says the
stored unit is a unit of its own rather than the displayed currency. No save says which unit
that is, so **nothing here is converted** and no rate is applied.

The weekly fields are weekly amounts; every other money field is one month's amount, or a
balance at the end of a month.
