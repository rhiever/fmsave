"""The people a club employs who are not players, and the lists a club keeps them in.

A row is one person at one club: the department list the club keeps him in, the terms of his
contract, his ability, and the preferences a staff profile shows. The human manager is a row of
his own with no readable ability.

**The club's board is not here.** A club's staff screen shows its president, its director and
its managing director beside the coaching and medical staff, and none of the three has a row in
the staff structures this reads; the rest of that screen's people matched a row one for one.

    """One member of staff at one club.

    A person listed by a club's affiliate side and paid by the club itself is **one row at the
    club**, with the side that lists him in `listed_club_uid`, the same rule a player on a B
    team follows. A person a club lists but pays nothing has no contract to read, so `wage`,
    `contract_start` and `contract_end` are None rather than zero.

    `unknown["contract_e36"]` and the three codes beside it are **not** player squad statuses:
    they come from the same bytes but take different values on staff, and no displayed label has
    named one, so they ship as raw numbers and never as a `SquadStatus`.

    **The job title is not readable, and `unknown["r4"]` is not it.** That byte was the one
    candidate for it, and a club's staff screen ruled it out: over 78 displayed rows, 8 of the
    16 codes on show carried two or more different job titles, 7 titles appeared under two or
    three different codes, and one code carried seven titles on its own. So `r4` keeps its raw
    number for good rather than becoming a named role, and the codes that happen to sit on one
    title at one club are not evidence of a meaning the field demonstrably does not have.

    The human manager is a row with `is_human_manager` true. His object is laid out differently,
    so `ability`, `preferences` and every `unknown` key read from the ability block are absent

        listed_club_uid: The club whose own staff list holds him, which is club_uid unless an
