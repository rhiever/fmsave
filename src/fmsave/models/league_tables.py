"""Live league tables: one table per group of blocks, one row per club in it.

A table is a group of blocks the save stores together, not a record with a header: nothing in
the group names its competition, so the competition is voted for from the fixture calendar and
is None on the groups the vote cannot settle. Those groups are still returned.

`LeagueTableRow.position` is the club's place in the table, counting from one. The save stores
each table already in standings order, so this is the league position and the rows need no
sorting. Do not re-sort them: the game separates clubs level on points by their results against
each other first, and no field here carries that, so a sort by points and goal difference moves
clubs the save had in the right order. That sort reproduces the stored order on 91.1%, 93.7%
and 93.2% of tables across the three saves measured, and on 73%, 74% and 67% of the
division-shaped ones; the disagreements are where the head-to-head rule decides.

Derived views these records carry no field for:

- goal difference is `goals_for - goals_against`;
- a division is `18 <= club_count <= 26 and rows[0].rounds_per_venue == club_count - 1`, a shape
  rule that holds in any country and needs no competition name;
- a club's remaining fixtures are the set difference between the group's member teams and the
  opponents already in `matches`, per venue; the save stores no remaining-fixture list;
- resolved groups only is `.filter(lambda table: table.competition_id is not None)`;
- a club's row in a competition is `.where(competition_id=...)` and then the row whose
  `club_uid` matches. fmsave never picks the group for the caller, because a club is in several
  groups at once.
