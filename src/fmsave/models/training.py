"""Training calendars, saved schedules and mentoring groups of the club a manager runs.

The save keeps one calendar per **team**, not one per club: the first team, the reserves, the
youth side and the teams the club fields at the clubs it controls each have their own, and no
club but the managed one has any at all. So the rows here are the teams of one club, and each
carries the team it belongs to.

**Which week runs which schedule is settled.** The save writes each week as its start date
followed by a schedule name, and the name belongs to the date written before it: a manager's
own Training screen showed the same schedule against the same week for four consecutive weeks,
where pairing each name with the following week -- what one earlier reader of this format did
-- would have been a week out on every one of them. The week's own start date is not in doubt
either: consecutive weeks step exactly seven days on every pair of every calendar measured.

What a week's sessions actually are is not read: each day holds three codes with no known
meaning, and nothing here presents them.
