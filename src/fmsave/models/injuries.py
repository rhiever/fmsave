"""Injury records: the names the game gives the injuries it can hand out, and who was hurt.

The names are the game's own text, as the save stores it, in the language the save was written
in. They are not in any section of the save: every per-match file the save holds carries one
copy of the table, so a save that holds no per-match file has no names at all. Some injury
codes have no entry in the table, so a code a player's injury carries need not be named here
and reads as no name at all. **fmsave ships no injury names of its own**, whatever a screen
displays for such a code, exactly as it ships no competition names.

The history is one table of two kinds of row. A `HISTORY` row is an injury the save remembers
happening: when it happened, and which team the person was at. A `TYPED` row carries the injury
type of a recent or current episode, and **its date is the day the player is expected back**
rather than the day he was hurt. The save keeps the history for about the last two years only.

**A `HISTORY` row is not a row of the game's Injury History tab.** That tab reads the
full-career store, which fmsave does not ship: it shows injuries from years outside this
rolling window, so the store here is the recent part of a career the tab shows whole.
