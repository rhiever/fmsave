"""Contract records: the chain of registrations, its tail fields and clauses.

A player's contract is assembled from a chain of registration records (one per club a
player has been registered to, oldest first), each carrying a wage and a start date, and
some of them a parsed "tail" of further fields (an end date, squad status, contract type
and clauses). When no chain record's tail parses, a separate fallback reader inside the
player's record can still supply a start or an end date. See `readers/contracts.py` for the
assembly rules.
