"""The corporate facilities rating a club's own record carries.

One row per club that keeps a monthly finance series, which is the clubs of the one or two
league nations a save tracks rather than every club it holds. The value is the rating the
game's Facilities screen shows as a word on its Corporate line, and the save keeps it as a
small number with no text beside it.

**Seventeen of the twenty codes have a word.** Fifteen were read off a club's own Facilities
screen, one club per code, and the words rise with the number: several numbers share a word,
which is what a rating shown as a word rather than a number looks like. Two more are named
because they are bracketed, not because a pattern was extrapolated. The three codes no club in
the save carried are `UNKNOWN` and keep their raw number: a word nobody has seen displayed is
silently wrong where a raw number is plainly incomplete.

The screen's other facility lines -- the stadium, the pitch, the training and youth grounds,
the academy -- have no candidate byte anywhere near this one, so nothing here reads them.

    A member's value is the lowest code its word was displayed against; every code the word
    covers reads as that member and keeps its own raw number.

    **Fifteen codes are named by a screen.** One club's Facilities screen per code displayed
    that word against that exact stored number: 1 and 2 Basic, 5 Fairly Basic, 6, 7 and 9

    a scale whose words rise with the number each of those can only be the word its
    neighbours carry. Nothing else is filled in that way.

    **Codes 3, 4 and 16 are UNKNOWN**, because no club in the save carries them: 3 and 4 are
    below the lowest Fairly Basic seen and 16 sits between a Good and an Excellent, so neither
    a screen nor a bracket names them. The reading that the words sit in fixed bands of the
    scale would name them, and it is a hypothesis rather than an observation, so it is not
