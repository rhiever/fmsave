"""Per-save state that readers share: decompressed sections on loan, and cached results.

A reader borrows a section's bytes with `section(name)`. Nested borrows of the same
section share one decompressed bytes object, which is dropped when the outermost borrow
ends, so a whole section is never kept alive between reader calls. Results that are
cheap to keep (tables and small indexes) go in the cache through `cached(key, build)`,
which also remembers a pass that failed so nothing pays to decode it twice. Closing the
context drops both; values already handed out keep working.
