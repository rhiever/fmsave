"""The user-supplied map from a competition's editor database id to its name.

No save holds a competition name: the game renders them from its own installed database. fmsave
therefore ships no names, reads no game install and makes no network call. What it does ship is
`Competition.database_id`, the competition's id in the game's editor database, which is the same
value in every save and is what every name source outside a save is keyed on. A reader who wants
names builds a map from that id once and passes it to `fmsave.open`, where it names competitions
in every save they own.

The map is keyed on the **database** id and never on the stage-space competition id, which
differs between saves and between databases.

Only the names in __all__ are public.
