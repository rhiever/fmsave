        `month` is worked out from the save's own date rather than stored: the last row of a
        club is the month before the save's month. Several useful figures are arithmetic on
        these rows rather than fields: wage headroom is `wage_budget_weekly` less

        at the parent**, with the side that lists him in `listed_club_uid`, the same rule a

        read, so his `wage` and both dates are empty rather than zero; about one listed person
        in seven of a save is like that.

        **The save's human manager is a row of his own**, with `is_human_manager` true. His
        object is laid out differently, so no ability, no preferences and none of the
        ability-block `unknown` keys read for him, while his name, birth date, personality and
        contract read as anyone's do.

        **The contract codes are not player squad statuses.** `unknown["contract_e36"]` comes
        from the byte a player's squad status is read from, but it takes different values on
        staff and no displayed label has named one, so it and the three codes beside it ship as
        raw numbers. The job title is not readable at all: the byte most likely to carry it
        ships as `unknown["r4"]`.

        Several useful figures are arithmetic on these rows rather than fields: a club's
        non-playing wage bill is the sum of `wage` over its rows, how many of its staff it
        lists is `where(in_club_lists=True)`, and who it pays without listing is
